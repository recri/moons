* Todo list for Moons 2018-07-03
[ ] convert the current generator into an incremental renderer
	as the calendar gets the ephemeris for each month
	and then rerenders the visible months with ephemerides
[ ] this could be a continuous scrolling moons calendar
[ ] if we could render the svg for the calendar into text
	then people could take that to the printer.
[ ] separate the computational from the rendering, it's a bit
	interleaved at the moment
[ ] do the computation in the web worker, have it post back the
	results, so it needs to know the required values, meanwhile 
	the generator posts new requests as the old are completed.
[ ] run multiple workers in parallel
[ ] draw planets, nodes, gees, zodiacal signs in the top and bottom margins
	with the day numbers.
[ ] provide a simple ephemeris page, too, or pages by date
[ ] provide navigational stars locations
[ ] work out how to get time and location fixes from pictures of the
	sky
